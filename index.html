    <p>Graffities used to be considered vandalism and delinquent behaviour.</p>
    <p>They have now become a well-respected art form through “street art”.</p>
    <p>Where graffiti is used to refer to paintings of names and characters on urban surfaces, street art refers to a more elaborated form that also includes the early graffiti movement but has evolved into spray paintings, mosaics, posters, knitting installations…</p>
    <p>As such, graffiti artists have been using their skills to make art that stops people in their tracks and some of these artists have made a name for themselves in the more “prestigious” art scenes.</p>
    <p><strong>Graffiti artists like Banksy, Shepard Fairey, Zephyr, Blade, David Choe, Saber, and others have been incredibly influential for the genre.</strong></p>
